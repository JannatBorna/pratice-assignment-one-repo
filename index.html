               <p>My personal definition of a professional developer is a developer who is able to build and maintain a commercial piece of software. In other words, if said developer made or edited software, and that software is generating money for someone somewhere even indirectly.</p>

              <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working environment, the transition is never easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting.</p>
